Canal Bank Walk

Leafy-with-love banks and the green waters of the canal
pouring redemption for me that I do the will of God
to wallow in the habitual, the banal
Grow again with Nature as before I grew.
The bright stick trapped, the breeze adding a third party
to a couple kissing on an old seat
and a bird, gathering materials, for the nest, for the Word
eloquently new and abandoned to its delirious beat.
O unworn world enrapture me, enrapture me in a web 
of fabulous grass and eternal voices by a beech
Feed the gaping need of my senses, give me ad lib
to pray unselfconsciously and with overflowing speech.
For this soul needs to be honored, with a new dress woven
From green and blue things and arguments that cannot be proven.
